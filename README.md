# COMPONENT#3 - Tire condition assessment using image recognition 
## Description -   
Tire quality is crucial for automobile safety and performance, yet traditional methods of assessing tire conditions are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.​ To address these limitations, our research focuses on developing an intelligent tire assessment system using image processing and machine learning technologies.

## Features
Tire quality assessment: Providing a report on the quality of tires 

Mileage prediction: giving current mileage and remaining mileage 

## Technologies
Matplotlib: Used for visualization​

OpenCV: Used to Convert images to grayscale​
	: Identify contours of tread patterns.​
	: Measure contour spacing or depth.
 
Data Augmentation: By expanding the dataset, techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming enhance model generalization.​

Google Colab: Cloud-based platform for development and testing.​

TensorFlow/Keras: Optional for machine learning-based predictions.

# COMPONENT#4 - Intelligent Vehicle Damage Detection and Repair Recommendation System
## Description- 
This component focuses on automating vehicle damage detection and repair recommendations. Using machine learning and image processing, it identifies damage from images and leverages social media data to recommend repair shops based on reviews and trends.
 
## Features-
Automated Damage Assessment: identify vehicle damage for repair needs.
Mechanic shops Recommendations: Integrate social media data to suggest top-rated shops.

## Technologies-
Using OpenCV and CNN models to detect and classify damage.
TensorFlow or PyTorch for training and deploying the damage detection model.
Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition for analyzing shop reviews.
Python libraries like NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers, or TextBlob for NLP tasks.
